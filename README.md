# Phylogenetic Biology - Final Project

# Transitions in Plethodontidae Scapula Morphology

## Introduction and Goals

For my final project, I plan to focus on salamanders in the family Plethodontidae. This family exhibits two feeding types, both of which involve tongue projection: muscle-powered feeding and spring-powered feeding. Spring-powered tongue projection, which relies on stored elastic energy, is comparatively more forceful than muscle-powered feeding (Scales 2020). In addition to these two feeding classes, some salamanders perform a forward lunge in tandem with tongue projection (Wake & Deban 2000). It is hypothesized that this forward lunge may provide additional power or accuracy to tongue projection, but this has not yet been confirmed.

I spent the summer working in the Peabody Collections studying preserved salamander specimens. My research was focused on salamander forelimb architecture. I predicted that muscle-powered feeders may have forelimb structure that is better-optimized for forward lunges. In this sense, the forward lunge may be a compensatory mechanism for less powerful feeders.

To visualize differences in forelimb skeletal structure, I segmented ~20 different taxa within the family. Specifically, I focused on the scapula, humerus, radius, and ulna. To quantify differences in trait values, I plan to eventually use a geometric morphometrics program developed by Dr. Zachary Morris. For this investigation, I will be using simple linear measurements of different features along the scapulae. Therefore, I will be using my own data.

The goal of my project is to determine how forelimb morphology has evolved in Plethodontidae salamanders. I will use PGLS analysis to assess the correlation of feeding mode with scapula shape in lungless salamanders. Specifically, I will be considering the acromion and coracoid processes, two features that vary between scapulae.

Ultimately, I would like to compare the evolutionary transition of forelimb morphology to the appearance of spring-powered or muscle-powered feeding. With this comparison, it may become evident if natural selection is acting on optimized forelimb morphology for muscle-powered feeders, making the weakest feeders the best lungers.

This is part of a larger project that I will present at SICB 2023.
